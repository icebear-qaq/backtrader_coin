## Introduction  
`backtrader_coin` is a self-developed cryptocurrency backtesting framework. Its core modules include `FakeBroker` (simulated trading), multiple built-in strategies (dual moving average, Bollinger Bands, ATR, etc.), and a Web UI for result visualization. Future plans include integrating Binance for live trading (under development), while currently focusing on efficient backtesting and strategy development.

## How to Use AI to Write and Backtest Strategies  
Want to create your own strategy? AI (such as ChatGPT) can help. Follow these steps:  
1. Go to `coin/strategy/` and copy an existing strategy file.  
2. Paste the code into an AI model and describe your desired strategy.  
3. Save the AI-generated strategy in the `coin/strategy/` folder, e.g., `macd.py`, then call it in the main program:  
    ```python  
    strategy = MACDStrategy()  
    engine = BacktestEngine(broker, strategy)  
    engine.run(data)  
    ```
